          <p class="card-text">In order to land a plane, first tou have to somehow get it up to the air. The best way of
            doing that is called a <strong>plane take-off</strong>. During this event, the plane goes from "mmm" and
            "hrrrm" all the way to "WRRRRRM" state. Since this is not why you are on this page, we will
            not elaborate on this step any further.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Once your plane is in the air, it has to stay there for a while. This step is also called
            a <strong>flight</strong>. Open your window and look up - there is a chance you might spot a flying plane
            right above your head! Since this is the most boring part (yawn), we will not elaborate on this step any
            further.</p>

          <img src="./images/landing.jpg" alt="Plane landing" class="card-img">
          <p class="card-text">And finally - <strong>landing</strong>! Since you can not keep flying your plane forever
            (it gets boring very fast), sooner or later you need to get back on the ground. To do that, you need to
            perform a landing on an airport. Or anywhere else, if you desire a little adrenalin in your blood.</p>
