# CSS Flexbox exercise

Very simple page about planes and how to land with them.

You won't find anything advanced here, since I have created it at the beginning of my front-end journey to put my fresh knowledge about Flexbox, as well as pretty much everything I knew to code, into use.

CSS rules are quite a mess, but at that time I did know how to write them more efficiently. I have decided to leave them as they are, just to set a starting point of my journey and allow you to evaluate all the progress I have made since then.
